<h1>WAPCHAN IS BACK!</h1>
<h2>The below will be preserved for posterity. Thanks for keeping the faith, wapnons.</h2>

<h1>WE ARE IN CRISIS!</h1>
 <img src="ran.jpg" alt="ran.jpg">
<p>On November 14th 2022, Wapchan was attacked by a malicious actor who posted illegal content and self reported it, causing our host to take down the site.
While we have dealt with automated spam for ages, this was a deliberate action designed to deplatform our community.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE</b> I am in correspondance with our host, so things should be back online in a few days. I am leaving the below in case this does not occur.<p>
<p>I still have access to the older server
Wapchan ran on from January-April, so I am putting up this site as a temporary holdover. <b>I want to emphasize that WAPCHAN WILL RETURN!</b></p>
<h2>FUTURE PLANS</h2>
<p>Wapchan will remain an imageboard. The fourm idea was born out of desperation, but I realized that would kill the spirit of the site. Sorry for making you worry, /lum/frens.</p>
<p>Here's some actual plans to hopefully make this site workable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Captchas are coming back, mostly because we don't have enough staff to manually clean up automated spam in a timely manner</li>
<li>Better coordination of mods/jannies (especially in terms of coordinating times) and another recruting wave.</li>
<li>Possibly an alternative to IRC being explored (or just moving to Rizon to have chat contact if the server goes down again</li>
</ul>
<p>It is tough trying to satisfy everyone especially when I am doing a bit of everything (dev/backend/frontend/server management), but hopefully I can get more staff to volunteer and help with all this.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Wapchan is a passion project that serves no ads and makes no money. Sometime's its hard trying to manage this in addition to all the other stuff I do in my life, but hopefully you stick with me.</p>
<p>There's a bright future ahead for /ar/ and all the other boards around here.</p>
<h2>STAY UPDATED</h2>
<p>Since the vast majority of Wapchan's services were self hosted, many will have to be setup once again. For those looking to discuss what is happening:<p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the #wapchan channel on Rizon IRC</li>
<li>I will be setting up a (temporary) Discord server</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also avaliable at <a href="mailto:admin@wapchan.org">admin@wapchan.org</a>.</p>
<h2>STAY STRONG WAPNONS. WE WILL BE BACK SOON ENOUGH!</h2>
