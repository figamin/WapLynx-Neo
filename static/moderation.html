      <h1>Global moderation</h1>
      Any account have a numeric global role assigned to it. If this role is
      lesser than 4, it means the user is in the global staff.
      <br>
      Root: 0
      <br>
      Admin: 1
      <br>
      Volunteer: 2
      <br>
      Janitor: 3
      <br>
      Anything above 3 or undefined is considered a regular user. Janitors are
      able to delete any post or thread on the site and to close global reports.
      <br>
      Volunteers are able able to lift and issue any kind of global ban.
      <br>
      Admins are able to add or remove volunteers and janitors, to delete and
      transfer boards. They are also able to create boards when board creation
      is disabled.
      <br>
      Roots are able to assign admins.
      <br>
      The first admin or root will have to have it's role set using the terminal
      arguments. Consult the readme.md on src/be for instructions on that. Any
      role have all the powers of the less <span title="[TRIGGER WARNING] :^)">privileged</span>
      roles. When your account has access to the global staff tools, a link on
      your account page will be displayed.

      <h1>Board moderation</h1>
      A board have it's board owner and board volunteers. Board volunteers are
      added by the board owner and are able to delete content on the board,
      lock, pin, make threads cyclic, close board reports and apply bans for the
      board.
      <br>
      Board owners are able to do that, plus they are able to transfer or delete
      their own boards, add board banners, filters, custom css and rules and
      change the board settings.

      <h1>Custom CSS</h1>
      Board owners can add a css file to their boards, just using the upload
      form on the board management page. To delete the custom css file, click
      the upload button without entering any files.

      <h1>Reports</h1>
      Any non-banned user is able to report content, as long as said content
      haven't been reported yet.
      <br>
      Open reports will be displayed on the main moderation page with a link to
      the reported content and a button to close the report.
      <br>
      Closed reports are not deleted and they are available on the closed
      reports page.

      <h1>Deleting content</h1>
      As long as you are logged in, your global role and board role will be
      verified when you try to delete content AS LONG AS YOU DON'T INPUT A
      PASSWORD.
      <br>
      If you input a password, your account will not be validated and the system
      will try to use the deletion password you provided.

      <h1>Acessing moderation tools</h1>
      When you open a thread, there will be a link that will lead you to the
      moderation page for that board and thread, with all the moderation tools
      for that thread.

      <h1>Thread settings</h1>
      Threads have 3 settings: pin, lock and cyclic.
      <br>
      Pin will make a thread be listed above all others, no matter how long it
      was it's last bump.
      <br>
      Lock will prevent anyone from posting on a thread.
      <br>
      Cyclic will make the thread never get into auto-sage. Instead it will
      delete old posts when it hits the post limit that would trigger auto-sage.

      <h1>Bans</h1>
      To apply bans, select the checkboxes on the left top corner of postings
      and write an expiration for the ban. The date format must be parseable
      using the date parse of javascript.
      <br>
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse">Technical
        reference.</a>
      <br>
      Bans can be lifted from the bans page that can be accessed from the
      moderation pages.
      <br>
      Optionally, you can enter the ban reason and message. The ban message will
      be displayed on the post itself instead of the default ban message set in
      the site configurations. Global staff with the power to apply bans can
      select the checkbox to apply a global ban.
      <br>
      The ban reason will appear for both the user and on the bans list.

      <h1>Range bans</h1>
      It is also possible to ban entire IP ranges based on the first two parts
      of it. Notice that the range of the poster's ip can be seen on the
      moderation page for threads. Enter this range on the box in the range bans
      page and select to apply it.

      <h1>Hash bans</h1>
      Files can also be banned, keeping anyone from posting them. Copy the md5
      of the file shown in the thread moderation page and input it on the hash
      bans page.

      <h1>Board settings</h1>
      There are many ways to customize how a board works in general.
      <br>
      Disable captcha will disable captcha for the board completely. Keep in
      mind that will expose the board to flood, since there are no anti-flood
      tools in place yet.
      <br>
      Force anonymity will disable the name field completely. Role signature can
      still be used for an user to identify himself to some extent.
      <br>
      By default, users can be identified inside threads by an unique id that
      will use the user's ip. This behavior can be disabled by checking the
      option to disable thread-wise ids.
      <br>
      The [code] tag allows for posts to transform text in this tag into a
      non-formated text that is best used to display code.
      <br>
      The name used for anonymous posters, board name and description can also
      be changed.
      <br>
      Board message will be displayed above the posting form and accepts any
      most of posting markdown plus custom links using [displayed
      text](address).

      <h1>Filters</h1>
      Filters change a term for another term.

      <h1>Banners</h1>
      One can add customized banners for a board, they will be displayed
      randomly for users.

      <h1>Rules</h1>
      <p>Rules can be written and will be made visible on the rules.html
        page of the board.</p>

      <h1>Board message markdown</h1>
      It is similar to standard posting markdown with some differences:
      <br>
      It won't handle quotes.
      <br>
      Links won't be handled the same way, you have to use standard markdown for
      them.
      <br>
      For example: [A link](http://hurr.durr) becomes
      <a href="http://hurr.durr">A link</a>
      <br>
      [code] tag won't be applied.
