      <p>Wapchan prides itself on being a small, comfortable corner of the net to anonymously discuss old anime & manga as well as other topics. However, like almost all imageboards, Wapchan is regularly hit by automated CSAM attacks, which are not only degenerat beyond all belief, but actively threaten this site's ability to stay online. Therefore, we need dedicated users of this site to volunteer to remove this content whenever it appears. Communication will be done through Email and Discord/IRC.
