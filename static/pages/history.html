  <h1>A brief history of Wapchan</h1>
    <fieldset id="settingsFieldset" class="spacerFieldset">
      <legend>｢the lum connection｣</legend>
      <p>Wapchan's roots can be traced back to (what was in my opinion) the golden age of /lum/ on 4chan's /a/nime board. I used to post a lot there, first starting in November 2020, and became a regular ranposter. After the threads started to go downhill back in March of 2021, I started the weekly UY storytime a month later, but that ultimately got abandoned due to the new manga translation being too far behind at the time. A few elements that would later become a part of wapchan (cytube streams and an IRC server) got their start there, and is part of the reason this site has a strong connection to Urusei Yatsura</p>

      <p>the idea was shelved for a while though. tinyIB was too limiting and setting up other software proved to be a pain. i also wasn't a fan of of lynxchan's default interface. so life moved on throught the fall, but the idea happened to come up again when i was working on the alternative 2021 /a/ collage. i decided "what the heck" and got myself a vps and started up wapchan on new years eve (post 1 is on the 31st). ever since then, i've been adding features and services to the site.</p>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="settingsFieldset" class="spacerFieldset">
      
      <legend>what does the name mean?</legend>
    <p>wapchan was inspired by the term "wapanese", which is an old term that meant "white japanese", or someone obsessed with japanese culture. it's a fitting name for the theme of this site.</p>
  </fieldset>
    <fieldset id="settingsFieldset" class="spacerFieldset">
    <legend>why are there so few boards?</legend>
    <p>i didn't want wapchan to become a ghost town with tons of dead boards, or to be a bad clone of 4chan. this is why wapchan tries to go for smaller, more unique boards. popular suggestions will most likely be added.</p>
    </fieldset>
    
    <fieldset id="settingsFieldset" class="spacerFieldset">
      <legend>privacy and data integrity</legend>
      <p>wapchan commits to not sharing any data about it's users. i don't run any sort of analytics software at the moment, and even if i started using some, it would be self hosted and only used to get a sense of some broad trends. but as stated before, this data would not be shared or sold. i'm not running any ads currently and don't plan to, though in the future i may offer users to buy "ads" (for threads or whatnot) to help support the site. </p>
